# Sprint8-Project
Sprint8 - Data Visualization with Python


For Sprint 8's project, we are given a dataset and a graphical representation. The primary objective is to replicate the given graphical depiction using the supplied dataset wtih either the Seaborn or Plotly library.

The dataset encompasses the outcomes of a simulated research study, wherein 100 red squirrels were subjected to one of three distinct dietary regimes post-weaning, and their final adult weights were meticulously documented. The graphical representation presented below encapsulates the findings of this investigation and serves as the benchmark for the replication task. The choice between Seaborn and Plotly is placed by my discretion. Upon completion, we are required to submit a Jupyter Notebook in .ipynb format, inclusive of your code implementation and the resultant figure it generates. To pass, the reviewer will execute my code and juxtapose my figure against the original.

The deliverables to replicate within the project:
- Title and axis labels
- Axis ticks and their respective ranges
- Legend
- Magenta and green data points (the color exactness is not obligatory)
- Data grouping and presentation
- Other attributes of the figure, such as font size, style, or image dimensions, may be tailored tomy preference.
- Utilize official documentation or external references to address tasks not explicitly covered in this course section supplemented by additional resources as needed.

Furthermore, there is a disclaimer stated within the project: there can be multiple valid solutions to this project. The code's specifics will depend on whether Seaborn or Plotly is opted for. And even within a single library, various methods may be employed to achieve the same outcome.
